# TelegramBots
As the repository name suggests, this is a place to find samples of bots for the messaging service telegram. For now the bots are written in python3 and here for educational purposes. Feel free to reuse code with or without crediting me.
If you want to contact me you can either do this on Telegram @PhilippFeldner or use my email: feldnerphilipp@gmail.com
